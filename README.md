Final Project for SYS611 Systems Modeling & Simulation at Stevens Institute of Technology

Objective:  
Analyze CitiBike data to develop a strategy that minimizes over or under supply of bikes at a Central Park station.

Background:  
This project was completed in Mid 2022. I had little to no experience to simulation modeling prior to this course, and this final project was an attempt to utilize what I had learned to develop an optimization strategy by using analysis and simulations as tools for verification and validation. Unfortunately, the full modeling was not complete, but there are still useful insights gained from what analysis was complete.
